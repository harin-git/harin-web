How has popular music evolved across time and space? Have modern technology and the internet fundamentally changed the way we consume and share music? 

Until recently, these questions remained largely unanswered due to limited data and analytical tools. The digital age and advances in machine learning have changed everything, opening up exciting new avenues for scientific research on music.

Throughout my PhD, I've assembled an extensive dataset comprising some 250,000 popular songs from around the globe, spanning from the 1950s to the present day. This collection is complemented by a massive ongoing radio monitoring project covering 220 countries, which has already accumulated tens of terabytes of audio data of spoken conversations and music. 

Applying cutting-edge machine learning tools to this vast library, including music information retrieval, natural language processing, and social network analysis, my collaborators and I sought to characterise the global history of popular music through a data-driven approach.

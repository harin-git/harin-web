## *Harin Lee*

I'm interested in decoding various aspects of cultural patterns. From the aesthetic choices we make as individuals (like selecting the perfect soundtrack for a Sunday brunch with friends), to how culture evolves and diffuses across cities and countries (like how k-pop became a global phenomenon). To achieve this, I gather massive datasets of music all around the world from archival recordings to online streaming data. I combine this with behavioural experiment paradigms by running cross-cultural experiments online using PsyNet and make field trips to collect data in the wild such as in the Bolivian Amazon.
  
I earned my PhD in Cognitive Science from the Max Planck Institutes in Germany (MPI CBS and MPIEA), supervised by Dr Nori Jacoby, Dr Marc Sch√∂nwiesner, and Dr Minsu Park.
